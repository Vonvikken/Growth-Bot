# Growth Bot

Telegram Bot for recording child growth.

## Description

I created this bot to monitor the growth of a baby by periodically entering the values of his/her weight and length.
Data about the percentile values are then displayed.

_More functionalities will come._

## Disclaimer

The displayed results are for information use only, and _cannot replace in any case_ those collected by a medic. Use
this software at your own risk!

The growth data are stored on a file in the same machine the bot is running on. No data will be sent to external
parties.

Percentile tables are taken from the [WHO site](https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/standards). All rights
belong to their respective owners.
